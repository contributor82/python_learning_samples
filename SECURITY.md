## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
This is just a Python learning sample. This is not yet completed. Once it is available for use. I will let you know. Till then DO NOT MAKE ANY UPDATES.
