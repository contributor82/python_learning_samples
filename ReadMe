# ReadMe is in progress. 

1. Create a "C:\Data" folder and keep the sample data files in it
2. Added and updated Python code samples from the documentation. 
3. For importing classes, use the relative path compared to the direct path if classes are part of the project folder. 
4. Using class structure when invoking modules. Most of the samples from Python documentation have been structured in a class to better formulate and use for Python programming. 
5. Applying the linting technique for fixing type-checking errors and using formatting options such as autopep8 or black or fancier options to format Python program files.
6. Performing local tests using "Pytest" for test-case verification before uploading it for build. 
7. Updating dependencies as & when required.
