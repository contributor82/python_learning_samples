# ReadMe is in progress. 

1. Create a "C:\Data" folder and keep the sample data files in it
2. Python code samples from the documentation going to refer to this path to read and write files. 
3. For importing classes, use the relative path compare to the direct path if classes are part of the project folder. 
4. Use class structure when invoking modules. Most of the samples from Python documentation have been structured in a class to better formulate and use for Python programming. 
5. Applying the linting technique for fixing type-checking errors and using formatting options such as autopep8 or black or fancier options to format Python program files.
